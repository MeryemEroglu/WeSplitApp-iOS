# WeSplit

## Overview
**WeSplit** is a practical iOS application developed using SwiftUI that helps users calculate how to split a bill among multiple people. The app allows users to input the check amount, select the number of people sharing the bill, choose a tip percentage, and then displays both the total amount and the amount each person should pay.

## Features
- **Bill Amount Input**: Enter the total bill amount with decimal precision
- **People Selector**: Choose from 2 to 99 people to split the bill
- **Tip Calculator**: Select tip percentage using an interactive wheel picker (0-100%)
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instantly see updates to both total amount and per-person share
- **Currency Formatting**: Displays amounts in the user's local currency
- **Keyboard Management**: Dedicated "Done" button to dismiss the numeric keyboard
- **Animated UI**: Spring animations when values change for better user experience
- **Clean Interface**: Organized in logical sections with clear labels
